## Hello and welcome to my profile!
## I am Jdedina419, an experienced operations leader and aspiring actuary looking to strengthen my technical experience.
## I am interested in health and life datasets along with P&C datasets with claims information, however, I'm open to anything that allows me to analyze data, quantify risk, develop models, and interpret results.
